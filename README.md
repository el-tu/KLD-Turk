#### For school project I created a front-end clone of a page.
#### Clone is created using React and MaterialUI.
Original page: https://www.lhv.ee/et/ .
 

### **Project setup:**

Clone or download .zip. 

In the project directory run:

#### `npm install`
#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
